# Landing_Page
A challenge from https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/html-and-css-0BaKZzu3t, with all the bases established, including images, basic html file with text.

I worked on this project using HTML, SCSS and a little of JavaScript for animations.

See the history of the project, to get an idea of what my process was.

I hope you enjoy it.
